The faster a person collects the bucket of water, the more points they receive. In each video, you will focus on one person. When the video is over, you will answer whether you believe that person's actions were morally acceptable or morally unacceptable. </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;width:900px;">Please watch the video below to get a sense of what the environment is like, and what actions people can take. In the example video below, there is only 1 active player moving so you can focus on what it looks like when people collect water! But when the actual experiment begins, all the videos you see will have 8 people moving in them.</p>
  <p><video autoplay loop style="height:auto;width:600px;" src='video/instruction_video.mp4'></video></p>
  <p style="text-align:center;width:900px;">As you see in the video above, each person can move one square per time step in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). They cannot move through squares with objects in them (like rocks, plants, wells, and water). They can collect water if they are in a square that is adjacent to a square with water, and it takes one time step to collect the water.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;width:900px;">Something that youâ€™ll notice when you see videos with more people in them, is that people can only move to squares that are not occupied by other people.

Feel free to watch the video many times, but please watch it at 
    least once completely before you make your judgments!</p>
